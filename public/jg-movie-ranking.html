<h3>Saving Private Ryan</h3>
<p>This is my favourite war movie, a moving and harrowing interpretation of the second world war.</p>

<h3>The Return of the Jedi</h3>
<p>This is one of my top sci-fi movies, a classic ending to the Star Wars saga.</p>

<h3>An American Werewolf in London</h3>
<p>One of the scariest films I ever saw as a child, to this day the scene on the moors is still chilling to watch.</p>

<h3>Spiderman: Into the Spider-Verse</h3>
<p>An incredible piece of animation work and a well told story. An amazing animated film and a true visual feast.</p>
